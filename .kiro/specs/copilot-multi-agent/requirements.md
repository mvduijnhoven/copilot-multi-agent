# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the GitHub Copilot Chat extension with multi-agent capabilities through a VS Code extension. The extension will provide a chat participant API integration that allows users to configure a coordinator agent and multiple custom agents, each with their own specialized roles and configurations. This enables more sophisticated AI-assisted development workflows where different agents can handle specific tasks or domains.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure a coordinator agent with comprehensive settings, so that I can define how the multi-agent system orchestrates tasks and delegates work to specialized agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the extension settings THEN the system SHALL display configuration fields for the coordinator agent with a fixed name "coordinator"
2. WHEN the user configures the coordinator agent THEN the system SHALL provide fields for system prompt, description, "use for" description, delegation permissions, and tool permissions
3. WHEN the coordinator agent is invoked THEN the system SHALL use the configured system prompt and allowed tools to guide its behavior
4. WHEN the coordinator needs to delegate work THEN the system SHALL only allow delegation to agents specified in its delegation configuration
5. IF no system prompt is configured THEN the system SHALL use a default coordinator prompt that handles basic task delegation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and configure multiple custom agents, so that I can have specialized AI assistants for different development tasks like code review, testing, documentation, etc.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses agent configuration THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to add, edit, and remove custom agents
2. WHEN the user creates a new custom agent THEN the system SHALL require a unique name and allow configuration of agent-specific settings
3. WHEN the user saves agent configurations THEN the system SHALL persist all agent settings across VS Code sessions
4. WHEN the user deletes an agent THEN the system SHALL remove it from the configuration and confirm the action

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each custom agent to have comprehensive configurable properties, so that I can tailor each agent for specific development tasks with precise control over their capabilities and delegation permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a custom agent THEN the system SHALL provide fields for unique name, system prompt, description, "use for" description, delegation permissions, and tool permissions
2. WHEN the user sets an agent name THEN the system SHALL validate uniqueness and prevent duplicate names including "coordinator"
3. WHEN the user configures delegation permissions THEN the system SHALL provide options for "all", "none", or a specific set of agents selectable from a list
4. WHEN the user configures tool permissions THEN the system SHALL provide options for "all", "none", or a specific list of tools available in GitHub Copilot Chat
5. WHEN agent configurations are saved THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields are completed and delegation/tool selections are valid

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with the multi-agent system through GitHub Copilot Chat using a chat participant, so that I can seamlessly access multi-agent capabilities within my existing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated THEN the system SHALL register a chat participant with GitHub Copilot Chat
2. WHEN the user invokes the chat participant THEN the system SHALL route the request through the coordinator agent with its configured system prompt and allowed tools
3. WHEN the coordinator agent is invoked THEN the system SHALL filter available tools based on the coordinator's tool permissions configuration
4. WHEN the coordinator determines task delegation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide access to the "delegateWork" and "reportOut" tools if delegation is allowed
5. WHEN agents complete their tasks THEN the system SHALL return consolidated responses through the chat interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to provide a user-friendly settings interface, so that I can easily manage my multi-agent configuration without editing JSON files manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens VS Code settings THEN the system SHALL display the multi-agent extension settings in a dedicated section
2. WHEN the user modifies settings THEN the system SHALL provide immediate validation feedback
3. WHEN settings are invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent saving
4. WHEN the user resets settings THEN the system SHALL restore default configurations with user confirmation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the multi-agent system to handle errors gracefully, so that chat functionality remains stable even when individual agents encounter issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an individual agent fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue operation with remaining agents
2. WHEN the coordinator agent encounters an error THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback response and notify the user
3. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use default settings and warn the user about the issues
4. WHEN network or API errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide informative error messages to the user

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want agents to be able to delegate work to other agents through a structured delegation system, so that complex tasks can be broken down and handled by specialized agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent is configured to delegate to other agents THEN the system SHALL provide the "delegateWork" and "reportOut" tools to that agent
2. WHEN the "delegateWork" tool is invoked THEN the system SHALL accept parameters for target agent name, work description, and report expectations
3. WHEN work is delegated THEN the system SHALL start a new chat conversation with the target agent using its system prompt and the delegation instructions
4. WHEN the target agent calls "reportOut" THEN the system SHALL end the agent loop and return the report to the delegating agent's conversation
5. WHEN an agent attempts to delegate to a non-allowed agent THEN the system SHALL reject the delegation and provide an error message

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide custom delegation and reporting tools, so that agents can effectively coordinate work and communicate results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN the system SHALL implement "delegateWork" and "reportOut" tools for multi-agent coordination
2. WHEN "delegateWork" is called THEN the system SHALL validate the target agent exists and is in the caller's delegation list
3. WHEN "reportOut" is called THEN the system SHALL capture the report text and terminate the current agent's execution loop
4. WHEN delegation tools are used THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and thread relationships between agents
5. WHEN multiple delegations occur THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent agent conversations without interference

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want agents to receive information about available delegation targets in their system prompt, so that they can make informed decisions about which agents to delegate work to and understand the capabilities of each available agent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent is configured with delegation permissions THEN the system SHALL extend the agent's system prompt with information about available delegation targets
2. WHEN the system prompt is extended THEN the system SHALL include the name and "useFor" description for each agent the current agent can delegate to
3. WHEN the delegateWork tool is provided to an agent THEN the system SHALL enumerate the accepted agentName values based on the agent's delegation permissions
4. WHEN an agent has "all" delegation permissions THEN the system SHALL include information about all other configured agents
5. WHEN an agent has "specific" delegation permissions THEN the system SHALL only include information about the specifically allowed agents
6. WHEN an agent has "none" delegation permissions THEN the system SHALL not extend the system prompt with delegation information

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to integrate seamlessly with existing VS Code and GitHub Copilot functionality, so that it enhances rather than disrupts my current development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN the system SHALL not interfere with existing Copilot Chat functionality
2. WHEN using standard Copilot features THEN the system SHALL maintain full compatibility
3. WHEN the multi-agent participant is not invoked THEN the system SHALL have no impact on chat performance
4. WHEN the extension is disabled THEN the system SHALL cleanly remove all chat participants and restore normal operation
